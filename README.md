**ISA Project:** Me and my groupmates were tasked to create and implement an 8-bit instruction set in Python. In main we decode and simulate a given text file with 8-bit binary instructions (which is checked if it is valid). Main is able to write the instructions it is doing in a seperate text file, but most importantly it writes the memory which has all of our valuable data that is stored. In a previous project we implemented the perceptron algorithm in MIPS assembly language which we now translated into our own instruction set so we can run it in our python simulator.
